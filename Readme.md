# Input Grades

This is my first Java program. It is a simple program that allows users to input grades and get an average and letter grade based on input. The program allows the user to specify how many grades to be input, change their mind if they want to input less, and error checks the validity of grades. The program then outputs an average grade, which is then rounded to a letter grade.
